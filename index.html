                        My work focuses on state estimation for legged robots; I'm specifically interested in what happens during contact events such as foot touchdown during locomotion. The impulsive nature of these events creates nonsmooth and potentially discontinuous dynamics which can cause many standard algorithms for control and state estimation to underperform or simply fail. In my PhD I have sought to create control and state estimation methods that are able to explicitly handle these contact events. I work on these problems with <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/amj1/">Aaron Johnson</a> in the <a href="https://www.robomechanics.net">Robomechanics Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. <b>I expect to complete my PhD in summer 2024 and I am looking for employment opportunities in state estimation, motion planning, prediction, and control. <a href="assets/pdfs/Joe_Payne_Resume_2024.pdf">My resume is available here</a>.</b></p>

                            <p>This project focuses on the mathematical properties of hybrid systems with state driven mode transitions (such as contact dynamics in legged robots). The goal is to understand how uncertainty evolves in hybrid systems to better estimate current state. The first paper on this topic was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2021.109752">Automatica</a>, a preprint version can also be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12233">arXiv</a>. The sequel paper which focuses on interacting with uncertain guards appeared at <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9981218">IROS 2022</a> and a preprint can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12729">arXiv</a>.

                            <p>Many modern SLAM systems provide inaccurate estimates of motion on legged robots, if they can provide estimates at all. This project is interested in determining what it is about the motion that causes failure, then using that information to improve SLAM algorithms and optimize gaits for state estimation. The paper was presented at ICRA 2022 as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9811634">Periodic SLAM: Using Cyclic Constraints to Improve the Performance of Visual-Inertial SLAM on Legged Robots</a>.</p>

The idea behind the robot is that many current legged robots consume a great deal of energy just to remain in a stationary upright position. In response to this, we took inspiration from the flamingo to reduce the energy to remain standing to zero while on a flat surface. We also made an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2_hNeDmH9U">overly dramatic video</a> on the robot.</p>

                            <p>This talk discusses the extention of saltation matrices to the consideration of uncertainty in the system model. This includes uncertainty in the guard location, which could take the form of unknown ground height for a legged robot, and uncertainty in reset map parameters, such as an unknown coefficient of restitution in an impact system.
